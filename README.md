# Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I'm passionate about new technologies and programming. I am a passionate computer science hobbyist, and am currently a student in high school. I enjoy all forms of programming, including web dev in Sveltekit, game dev in Unity, Godot, and custom engines in Rust with wgpu.

## ðŸ’» Projects

I have several projects on my GitHub profile, such as:

- [**`Natural Selection Simulation`**](https://github.com/Jax-Hax/Natural-Selection), this project was carried out as part of the
  DS51 course at UTBM. Its purpose is to create an ontology and an AI to solve a problem related to the detection of
  animal species through
  photographs. ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-000?&logo=Python) ![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TensorFlow-000?&logo=TensorFlow)
- [**`Web site like AIRBNB to leisure`**](https://github.com/thibault-chausson/projetWE4B), this project was carried out
  as part of the WE4B challenge organized by UTBM. Its purpose is to create a website similar to AIRBNB, but for
  leisure
  activities. ![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Angular-000?&logo=angular) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-000?&logo=typescript) ![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML-000?&logo=html5) ![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS-000?&logo=css3) ![FireBase](https://img.shields.io/badge/-FireBase-000?&logo=FireBase)
- [**`Operations research`**](https://github.com/thibault-chausson/challengeIT45), this project was carried out as part
  of the IT45 challenge organized by UTBM. Its purpose is to solve an optimization problem related to the management of
  specialized teachers to assist struggling students. Based on the teachers' skills and students' needs, the program
  will assign teachers to students in order to minimize the hours of classes without a specialized
  teacher. ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-000?&logo=Python)
- [**`MÃ©dical Chatbot`**](https://github.com/thibault-chausson/ds50-project) this project was carried out as part of the DS50
  course at UTBM. Its purpose is to create a chatbot capable of diagnosing a patient based on their symptoms. We use
  cosine similarity to compare the patient's questions to those in our dataset and identify the most similar question.
  We then use the answer to that question to respond to the patient. If we can't find a suitable answer, we use the GPT
  API. ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-000?&logo=Python) ![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TensorFlow-000?&logo=TensorFlow) ![GPT](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GPT-000?&logo=openai) ![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Flask-000?&logo=flask) ![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML-000?&logo=html5) ![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS-000?&logo=css3) ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Docker-000?&logo=Docker)
- Creating a Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) tracking website for the Junior Enterprise of N7 and UTBM, with the
  ability to create custom charts and dashboards. Additionally, it includes a cash flow monitoring feature. Moreover, I
  am currently developing a module to create questionnaires similar to GForm (work in
  progress). ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-000?&logo=node.js) ![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Angular-000?&logo=angular) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-000?&logo=typescript) ![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML-000?&logo=html5) ![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS-000?&logo=css3) ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-000?&logo=JavaScript) ![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-SQL-000?&logo=MySQL) ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Docker-000?&logo=Docker) ![auth0](https://img.shields.io/badge/-auth0-000?&logo=auth0) ![Chart.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Chart.js-000?&logo=chart.js)
