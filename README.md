## ðŸ’» Projects

I have several projects, such as:

- [**`Natural Selection Simulation`**](https://github.com/Jax-Hax/Natural-Selection), this project was carried out as part of the
  [SvelteHack 2023 Challenge](https://hack.sveltesociety.dev/) in 3 months. You visualize natural selection happening in real time with prey, predator, and apex predator. Built in 3D with BabylonJS!
- [**`Simulated Stock Challenges`**](https://github.com/Jax-Hax/StockShare) - this project was made for a stock challenge with my family, where each person gets 10k fake dollars to invest in whatever they want, with leaderboards and statistics.
- [**`Cognnect`**](https://cognnect.com) - this is unfortunately not open source, as it is a commercial application, but it was built to help my classmates check their grades, share assignment due dates, and study.
